# Moving Pattern Analysis of Data Collected from Personal Activity Monitoring Device

This is an educational project, which is the part of [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) provided by Johns Hopkins University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
movement using activity monitoring devices such as a
[Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike
Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or
[Jawbone Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of
the "quantified self" movement - a group of enthusiasts who take
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to
find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But
these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to
obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for
processing and interpreting the data.

## Data

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

It consists of data from personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

## Aims of study

The basic goal of this study is to explore the personal activity monitoring device data and answer some basic questions about activity patterns:

1. What are the statistical parameters of the number of steps taken per day?
2. What is the average daily activity pattern?
3. How missing values in dataset can be imputed?
4. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
